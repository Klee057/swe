# WhereToPark - Software Engnieering Group project
WhereToPark is a web application that enables drivers to effortlessly locate convenient carpark locations in close proximity to their destinations. The web application will be furnished
with other useful information such as parking fees, number of available lots and height limit of the car parks for users to make an informed decision.\
WhereToPark utilizes data from Google Maps and Data.gov.sg to enable our users to locate any car park within Singapore.

# Features
The app can:
- Request location access to find nearby parking spots
- Find nearby carparks based on user's location
- Show information of the selected carpark (via APIs)
- Allows searches of valid destinations
